# Stats_and_Public_Health_Project
 The goal of this project is to gain an understanding of how the city of Chicago, Illinois monitors mosquito populations and West Nile Virus (WNV) prevalence by placing traps around the city and studying captured specimens. I will then analyze the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding WNV at any particular time and location.
