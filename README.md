## About the Project
There are two parts to this project. The goal of part 1 of this project is to gain an understanding of how the city of Chicago, Illinois monitors mosquito populations and West Nile Virus (WNV) prevalence by placing traps around the city and studying captured specimens. The goal of part two is to analyze the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding WNV at any particular time and location.

I will be looking at the mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019.

The following open source packages are used in this part of the project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### The Data
<a name="p1-the-data"></a>
The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=159teLRYzRf8tbAUwlKZw_W68MGsn8gfR).

## Part 2: Data Analysis
<a name="part-2-data-analysis"></a>
I will perform basic and statistical analyses and focus on variables' relationships with mosquito counts and WNV probability.

### Prerequisites
<a name="p2-prerequisites"></a>
The following open source packages are used in this part of the project:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

### The Data
<a name="p2-the-data"></a>
A cleaned dataset will be used to do the analyses stated above. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iDftvcCuJ_uVR34ON2q4qCbBAla9IyH/view?usp=drive_link).
