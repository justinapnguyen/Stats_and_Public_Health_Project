# Stats_and_Public_Health_Project

## Description
There are two parts to this project. The goal of part 1 of this project is to gain an understanding of how the city of Chicago, Illinois monitors mosquito populations and West Nile Virus (WNV) prevalence by placing traps around the city and studying captured specimens. The goal of part two is to analyze the relationship between the different variables and the mosquito number, as well as the probability of finding WNV at any particular time and location.

I will be looking at the mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019;.

## Part 1: Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I will perform EDA and data wrangling techniques to gain comprehensive insights into the dataset.

### The Data
The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=159teLRYzRf8tbAUwlKZw_W68MGsn8gfR).

### Importing libraries
The libraries below are needed to perform EDA on the dataset.
```
import numpy
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot
import seaborn
import calendar
```

## Part 2: Data Analysis
I will perform basic and statistical analyses and focus on variables' relationships with mosquito counts and WNV probability.

### The Data
A cleaned dataset will be used to do the analyses stated above. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iDftvcCuJ_uVR34ON2q4qCbBAla9IyH/view?usp=drive_link).

### Importing libraries
The libraries below are needed to perform EDA on the dataset.
```
import numpy
import pandas
from scipy import stats
import seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot
import statsmodels.api
import statsmodels.stats.proportion
from datetime import datetime
import colorama
from colorama import Fore
```
